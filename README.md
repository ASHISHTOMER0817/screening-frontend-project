Repository for screening frontend Dev Candidates

As part of our evaluation, we would like to assess your development skills. Therefore, we have set up a short assessment to evaluate the candidateâ€™s skills by converting a simple component to be implemented using React with Tailwind CSS.

We specifically request that you refrain from using AI or automated tools in your assessment. We value your personal insights and development skills in this evaluation.

We are interested in your perspective on the development. Your responses will play a crucial role in our evaluation process.

Looking forward to receiving your insights on or before March 3, 2024. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out.

## Deliverables

after carefully evaluating the ![](Figma-Mockup.png), please create a rect application that calls [this mock json gist](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/telematum/7751eec667033ac8acd244542e464e18/raw/80882759f616955dea7ae334829d21c9f893c98c/todays.json) and display the data. Save time by not having images placed , rather use a colored placeholder.

When you are done, raise a PR in this repo with the source code and the built result ( the `dist` folder ) as well. Make sure to mention your email in the PR , as that would allow us to relate your application with the PR.
